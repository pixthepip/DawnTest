      <h1><center>Welcome to my Portfolio!<center></h1>
	  <br>
      <p>Hello there! I am Diana Hernandez, a multimedia
	  artist based in Peoria Arizona. I've spent the last 3
	  years conning my skills within the digital art field at
	  my lovely school, Glendale Community College. Some of my
	  current skills include graphic design, motion graphics/ animation,
	  and  photography. I specialize in designing flyers to provide that
	  provide all the necessary information in one destinated place.I also 
	  specialize in making and editing videos with special effects. In my art, 
	  I am inspired by animation, fluid linework, and emotional expression.
	  When I am not working, I enjoy traveling, reading, painting, caring for 
	  my plants, and nerdy things. If you want to check out my current works right now please click 
	  on any links located above.</p>

	  <p>From a young age, I was always interested in creating some form of art. 
	  Whether it was creating drawing on a piece of paper or trying to film a movie 
	  on my parenâ€™s phone, I was always interested in creating something that I found 
	  to be entertaining. With this mindset, I set my educational path forwards and pursued 
	  a degree in Multimedia Arts. Throughout high school, I took as many art classes as I 
	  could such as drawing, painting, and photography to help strengthen my skill and understanding 
	  of the arts. I also took a film and design class where I learned to make movies and edit content
	  using editing software within the Adobe Library. This is when I made the decision to follow the 
	  path of a Multimedia Artist. As of 2023, I am the first-generation Mexican-American to have graduated 
	  from any form of college in my family.  I have graduated with a certificate in Digital Multimedia Arts. 
	  Since then I have been working internships that allow me to use my skills to the best of my ability.</p>
